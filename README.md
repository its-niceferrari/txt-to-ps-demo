# txt-to-ps
Powershell script that outputs the filename and contents from text files in a given directory to the console.

After downloading the script file, change the placeholders to the address of the parent directory to be scanned. Currently, this only works when all the files are saved in plain text and are located in the same directory.

Files stored with the .RTF extension do work with a little bit of digging through the block of output text.
